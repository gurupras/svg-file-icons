### Colours
Other than the obvious fact that this library uses the UK spelling, currently, there is no easy way to change the colours. The colours are obtained from atom's icon database and baked into the library.

### Icon Sizes
The sizes of icons don't all match. Atom's stylesheet has specialized handling of several icons which isn't handled by the library. This is in the pipeline however, and should be fixed soon.
